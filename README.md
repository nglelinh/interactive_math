# Interactive Math: Numerical Methods in JavaScript

This project is set up to help you learn and experiment with interactive numerical methods using JavaScript. You can implement and visualize algorithms such as root finding, integration, and differential equations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Add your JavaScript files (e.g., `index.js`) and start coding your numerical methods.
3. For interactive and visual demos, consider using HTML and a library like [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) or [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Example Topics
- Root finding (e.g., Newton-Raphson, Bisection)
- Numerical integration (e.g., Trapezoidal, Simpson's rule)
- Solving ODEs (e.g., Euler's method)

## Project Structure
- `index.js` — Main entry point for your code
- `public/` — (Optional) Static files for web-based demos
