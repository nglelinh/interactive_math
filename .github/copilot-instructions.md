This project is for learning and experimenting with interactive numerical methods using JavaScript. Focus on clear, interactive, and visual implementations of algorithms such as root finding, integration, and differential equations.

The code should be well-commented, modular, and easy to understand for users who may not have a strong background in numerical methods. Prioritize readability and educational value over performance optimizations.

Beside add as much as mathematical context, formulas and explanations as possible to help users grasp the concepts being implemented.

Try to use modern JavaScript features and best practices to keep the codebase up-to-date and maintainable.

Add explaination on how the illustration works

Add some examples of math in each topic to allow better understanding
